## Install Velocitas

This project uses [Eclipse Velocitas](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas). However, the
[Velocitas CLI](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/cli) is not delivered as part of this project,
therefore the user is responsible to add it. We recommend putting the Velocitas CLI on the system
PATH and keeping it up-to-date.

You can use npm to deploy the project or use one of
the [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#obtaining-prebuilt-binaries).
